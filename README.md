E-commerce Order Tracking System
Project Overview
This project is a dynamic order tracking system for an e-commerce platform. It allows users to track their order details, view delivery status, and monitor the progress of their packages in real-time. The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and localStorage to store and retrieve order data dynamically.

Features
Order Listing: Displays a list of orders placed by the user.
Order Details: Shows order information including product name, quantity, and total cost.
Delivery Status Tracking: Tracks the package's delivery progress (e.g., preparing, shipped, delivered).
Local Storage Integration: Stores orders in the browser using localStorage, ensuring data persists even after the page is refreshed.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface that works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

Technologies Used
JavaScript: Handles the dynamic functionality of the app.
HTML/CSS: Provides the structure and design for the user interface.
localStorage: Used for saving and retrieving order data locally.
GitHub Pages: Hosts the live version of the project.

How It Works
The user places an order, which is stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage.
On the Orders page, all orders are retrieved and displayed with details like product name, total cost, and order date.
Each order contains a Track Package button that leads to a tracking page showing delivery status.
The Tracking page updates in real-time with delivery progress, including details on the expected arrival date.

Future Enhancements
Backend Integration: Connect to a database and server for real-time order tracking and updates.
User Authentication: Add a login system to manage user-specific orders.
Payment Integration: Include payment tracking and order confirmation features.
